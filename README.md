## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The 2020-21 NHL season was one for the history books as Covid-19 forced the NHL to create four separate divisions (North, Pacific, Central, and Atlantic). Only inter-divisional play took place during the regular season to limit the amount of physical contact between teams. This didn't stop Covid-19 outbreaks from occurring throughout the season as many players and coaching staff caught the virus. When a team conducted a case of Covid-19, they would have to isolate and miss substantial time before returning to play. Many teams missed up to two weeks of games and on-ice training to these outbreaks throughout the season. The games missed were made up by rescheduling them for later dates in the season. This project will analyze how Covid-19 outbtreaks affected the play of teams after having a substantial time off and if it affected their overall finsih in the standings. Every game played will be anaylyzed for each team so we can see how teams played before and after a Covid-19 outbreak and use that data to determine if the outbreaks hurt teams overall finishes in the standings. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data set we are using is from Natural Stat Trick as they have the most reliable and available data for advanced statistics when it comes to NHL teams and players. The data we are using will help explore a teams overall play in an even strength setting of five on five. The data set will include everygame played in the 2020-21 NHL season with the advanced statistics of Corsi Percentage (CF%), Save Percentage (SV%), Shooting Percentage (SH%), Time On Ice 5v5 (TOI5v5), and Scoring Chances (SCF%). Corsi Percentage meausres shot attempts such as shots on goal, missed shots, and blocked shots at the oppositions net minus the same shot attempts directed at your net (between 40-60% is considered good). Save Percentage will determine play in net and is the number of shots on goal a goaltender can save. Shooting Percentage meausres if a teams shots on goal reults in goals and determines if a team is scoring. Time On Ice will show the amount of time the team is disciplined and staying out of the peanlty box or on the powerplay. Scoring Chances is the percentage of total scoring chances for a team and helps show a team's possession of the puck.
