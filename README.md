# Group 23 - The Covid Ridden 2020-21 NHL Season

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Why This Topic?

The 2020-21 NHL season was one for the history books as Covid-19 forced the NHL to create four separate divisions (North, Pacific, Central, and Atlantic). Only inter-divisional play took place during the regular season to limit the amount of physical contact between teams. This didn't stop Covid-19 outbreaks from occurring throughout the season as many players and coaching staff caught the virus. When a team conducted a case of Covid-19, they would have to isolate and miss substantial time before returning to play. Many teams missed up to two weeks of games and on-ice training to these outbreaks throughout the season. This project will analyze how Covid-19 outbreaks affected a teams play after having substantial time off and if that substantial time off affected a team’s overall finish in the standings. It will also look at how each division played as a whole and which division played best. We are very interested in exploring this data to see how teams/divisions fared after Covid-19 outbreaks as this is the first time the NHL has experienced anything like this. A Dashboard will work exceptionally well with this data as it can be graphed and organized efficiently and be presented in a professional manner.  



## About Our Data Set

Brett- The data that is being provided for this project is from Natural Stat Trick. They have the most reliable and readily available data for advanced statistics when it comes to NHL teams and players. The data collected is from every game played in the 2020-21 NHL season with the five variables of Corsi Percentage (CF%), Save Percentage (SV%), Shooting Percentage (SH%), Time On Ice 5v5 (TOI5v5), Scoring Chances For Percentage (SCF%), and PDO. Corsi Percentage measures shot attempts such as shots on goal, missed shots, and blocked shots at the oppositions net minus the same shot attempts directed at your net (between 40-60% is considered good). Save Percentage will determine play in net by analyzing the number of shots on goal a goaltender can save. Shooting Percentage measures if a team’s shots on goal results in goals and determines if a team is scoring. Time On Ice will show the amount of time a team is disciplined and staying out of the penalty box or on the powerplay. Scoring Chances is the percentage of total scoring chances for a team and helps show a team's possession of the puck. PDO is a total of the SV% and SH% that helps determine how lucky a team was with the puck. The purpose of this data is to help analyze how teams performed before and after a Covid-19 outbreak. These advanced statistics will describe how a team is playing on all sides of the puck. Our data is collected by humans and technology. The game of hockey is growing in the data/statistical department and they are improving in ways of collecting data by using sensors, trackers, and cameras.     

Kyle- This data set was of great interest to myself as I grew up playing, watching and being consumed in the world of sports especially professional hockey. This topic of the National Hockey League and especially the Covid-19 season was of great interest for me as through Covid-19 not only sporting teams were being affected by the virus but also everyone on the planet. It dramatically affected a person’s mental wellbeing as well as their physical wellbeing. Thus, the Covid-19 NHL season statistics were a perfect fit. I would really like this analytics project to help sports fans and general society see the adverse effects of Coronavirus on a professional sporting league which is all about being in the best shape mentally and physically. The NHL was forced to created 4 divisions to geographically split up the teams. The North division comprised of all the Canadian teams was seen as the “weakest” division. I want to put this to the test, I will do this through comparing the North Divisions stats described below, and the other three American divisions seen as the “stronger” divisions.  his will be able to provide clarity on if Covid-19 divisions affect outcomes of the NHL.
